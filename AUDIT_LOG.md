# AUDIT LOG

## [2025-07-25] Remediation Entry
- Removed orphaned invalid line `get` at line 161 in `notrekt_mvp.py`.
- Reason: The line was not valid Python syntax and not part of any logic. It was likely a stray or accidental insertion.
- Action: File cleaned for audit integrity. No functional code was affected.

## [2025-07-25] Remediation Entry
- Audited `app/main.py` for import integrity and unresolved dependencies.
- [GAP]s flagged in code:

  - HITL decision logging and approval/rejection processing not implemented.
  - Additional endpoints and agent modularization pending.
- No broken imports or unresolved modules found in current code.
- No changes required at this stage; [GAP]s are already clearly marked in code.
