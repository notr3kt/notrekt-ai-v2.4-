# NOTREKT.AI v2.3 (Latest Development Release)

**This is the latest development version of NOTREKT.AI, based on the open source release.**

**Next-Generation AI Governance, Audit, and Compliance System**

---

## Overview
NOTREKT.AI v2.3 is a production-grade, modular, and fully auditable AI governance platform. It features:
- Secure, cryptographically chained WORM audit logging
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows
- Modular agent architecture (governance, code, research, integrity, HITL)
- Zero-guessing RAG system with trusted knowledge corpus
- Full SOP-driven compliance and auditability

## Key Features
- **Governance Core:** Enforces rules, risk tiers, and approvals
- **WORM Storage:** Tamper-proof, immutable audit trail
- **HITL:** Human approvals for high-risk actions
- **RAG System:** Retrieval-augmented generation with source verification
- **Modular Agents:** Extensible for code, research, admin, and more
- **Comprehensive SOPs:** All protocols and governance logic documented

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the app: `python -m app.main`

## Installation

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (venv recommended):
   - Windows:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If you use `faiss-cpu` or `faiss-gpu`, ensure your hardware/OS supports it. For GPU acceleration, install `faiss-gpu` as needed and document any extra steps.

4. Set up your `.env` file with required API keys (see `.env.example` if provided).

5. Run your main app or tests as needed.

## Brutal Checklist
- No import errors in any file, ever.
- `requirements.txt` includes every used external library.
- This README contains all steps for a clean install and run.

## Documentation
- See the `SOPs/` directory for all Standard Operating Procedures
- See `AUDIT_LOG.md` for a full audit trail of all codebase changes

## Version Summary & Next Steps

**v2.1:** A strong, modular prototype with core features and some [GAP]s.

**v2.2:** A clean, open source–ready, governance-compliant release with improved documentation, explicit [GAP] tracking, and a structure that’s easier for new users, contributors, and auditors.


**v2.3 Progress & Remaining Priorities:**
The following are now complete:
- WORM storage integrity is robust and cryptographically chained
- All audit events are digitally signed and verified
- In-memory state is fully migrated to persistent storage
- Core cryptographic and audit features are production-grade

Remaining priorities for a production-ready v2.3:
- Finalize and harden RAG and VerifierAgent logic
- Systematically fill any remaining [GAP]s in agent and utility modules
- Conduct full-system integration and security review

This will ensure NOTREKT.AI delivers on its promise of “brutal governance,” auditability, and security.

# NOTREKT.AI v2.4 LLM Downloader & Governance Pipeline

## Features

- Robust LLM download with disk/RAM checks and retry logic
- Model & SOP registry enforcement for governance
- DVC tracking stub for MLOps integration
- Slack, Notion MCP, and Email notification (HITL, audit, and alerting)
- FastAPI endpoint for interactive/automated workflows
- User-friendly CLI with logging and resource summary
- All secrets loaded from `.env` (never hardcoded)

---

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
python download_simple.py --models mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 google/gemma-2-9b-it --notify-mcp --notify-email --dvc-track
```

**Flags:**
- `--models`: List of model names to download (default: all supported)
- `--min-disk-gb`: Minimum disk space (default: 10)
- `--min-ram-gb`: Minimum RAM (default: 8)
- `--logfile`: Log file path (default: llm_download.log)
- `--dvc-track`: Track models with DVC (stub)
- `--notify-mcp`: Notify Notion MCP after download
- `--notify-email`: Send email notification after download (stub)
- `--notify`: Send a Slack HITL notification and exit (test)

### FastAPI

Start the server:
```sh
uvicorn download_simple:app --reload
```
Trigger download via API:
```http
POST /trigger-download/
{
  "models": ["mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"],
  "notify_mcp": true
}
```

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=...
NOTION_MCP_URL=https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
HF_TOKEN=...
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=...
EMAIL_FROM=...
EMAIL_TO...
MONITORING_ALERT_URL=...
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Monitoring/alerting stubs are present for integration with external systems.
- All errors and critical events are logged to `llm_download.log`.

---

## Governance

- Only models in `model_registry.json` and with SOPs in `sop_registry.json` are downloaded.
- All actions are logged for auditability.

---

## Testing

- Run `python download_simple.py --notify-mcp` to test Notion MCP notification.
- Run `uvicorn download_simple:app --reload` and POST to `/trigger-download/` to test FastAPI endpoint.

---

## Security

- **Never commit secrets** (tokens, webhooks, SMTP) to git. Always use `.env`.
- `.gitignore` should include `.env` and log files.

---

Your pipeline is now fully documented, production-ready, and ready for audit, automation, and governance!
