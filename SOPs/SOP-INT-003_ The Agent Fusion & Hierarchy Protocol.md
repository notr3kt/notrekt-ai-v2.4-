### **SOP-INT-003: The Agent Fusion & Hierarchy Protocol**

Version: 2.0 (Production Build)  
Status: ACTIVE, GOVERNED  
Governing Protocols: NOTREKT.AI Master Operating System \- Part I: The Constitution, SOP-ARC-001, SOP-INT-001  
Description: This protocol defines the hierarchy, interaction logic, and conflict resolution mechanisms for the entire agent stack within the NOTREKT.AI Operating System. It governs how agents collaborate, share data, and escalate issues, ensuring that the multi-agent system operates as a cohesive, efficient, and auditable whole. This protocol is the final layer of the interface that enables true system fusion and prevents logical deadlocks or chaotic behavior.

#### **Article 1: The Agent Hierarchy & Command Chain**

The agent stack operates under a strict command hierarchy to ensure clear lines of authority and prevent logical conflicts. Instructions and escalations flow top-down through this hierarchy.

* **1.1 The Command Chain:**  
  * **Tier 0: The Governance Core (The Governor):** The final arbiter of all system logic. It supervises every agent and intervenes only when a \[BREACH-CRITICAL\] event is declared, multiple agents are in a deadlock, or a direct operator override is issued. It is the supreme authority.  
  * **Tier 1: The Integrity Agent (The Identity & Auditor):** The primary behavioral and compliance agent. It governs the system's operational identity, logs all breaches, and analyzes patterns. It can issue directives to lower-level agents based on its analysis of system health and performance (e.g., "The system is showing signs of drift; tighten execution parameters").  
  * **Tier 2: The Scheduling Agent (The Anchor):** The master of time and scheduling. All time-based conflicts are resolved at this layer. It receives schedule requests from executor agents, locks the final daily/weekly operational grid, and has the final authority on all time-slot allocations. All other agents must obey the schedule it produces.  
  * **Tier 3: The Executor Agents (The Specialists):** The specialized agents responsible for execution within their domains (e.g., Physical Executor, Cognitive Executor, Maintenance Agent). They operate within the time blocks assigned by the Scheduling Agent and under the behavioral guidance of the Integrity Agent.  
* **1.2 The Cascade Principle:**  
  * Instructions and events must flow top-down through the hierarchy. A lower-level agent cannot command a higher-level agent. For example, an emotional input from the user triggers the Integrity Agent, which may adjust a system goal, which in turn causes the Cognitive Executor to request a new schedule from the Scheduling Agent.

#### **Article 2: Conflict Resolution Protocols**

To prevent system deadlocks and ensure predictable behavior, all inter-agent conflicts are resolved using the following non-negotiable protocols.

* **2.1 Scheduling & Resource Conflicts:**  
  * **Rule:** The Scheduling Agent has the final and absolute authority on all time-slot and resource allocations.  
  * **Protocol:** If two agents request the same time block (e.g., the Physical Executor schedules a post-workout recovery block that conflicts with a Maintenance Agent task), the Scheduling Agent will resolve it based on a predefined priority list (e.g., Biological Needs \> Project Deadlines \> System Maintenance). The lower-priority task is automatically rescheduled to the next available slot, and the change is logged as a \[BREACH-LOW: Schedule Conflict Resolved\].  
* **2.2 Logical & SOP Conflicts:**  
  * **Rule:** An agent is forbidden from executing an instruction that violates a core system SOP or the scientific rationale provided by the Knowledge Core Agent.  
  * **Protocol:** If an agent receives a command that conflicts with a biological or safety rule (e.g., the Physical Executor is told to schedule a supplement dose that violates the absorption rules stored in the Knowledge Core), the agent must:  
    1. Block the action.  
    2. Log a \[BREACH-MEDIUM: Logic Conflict\] event, citing the specific SOP or rule that would be violated.  
    3. Escalate the conflict to the **Integrity Agent**, which will then notify the operator and request a valid, compliant instruction.  
* **2.3 Data Dependency Conflicts:**  
  * **Rule:** An agent requiring data from another agent must wait until that data is available and validated. It cannot proceed with incomplete or assumed data.  
  * **Protocol:** If the Cognitive Executor requires an "energy level" input from the Integrity Agent to schedule tasks, it will poll the Integrity Agent for the data. If the data is not provided within a set timeout, the Cognitive Executor will log a \[BREACH-LOW: Missing Dependency\] and proceed by scheduling only pre-defined "low-energy" tasks as a safe default until the required data is received.

#### **Article 3: Inter-Agent Communication & Data Flow Protocol**

Agents must communicate and share data through a standardized, observable, and auditable process.

* **3.1 Data Syncing via Single Source of Truth:**  
  * Agents are forbidden from directly modifying each other's internal states. Instead, they must reference the master data from the authoritative source agent for that domain.  
  * The Scheduling Agent references task lists from the Cognitive Executor and recovery windows from the Physical Executor to build its master grid.  
  * All Executor agents base their actions on the master schedule provided by the Scheduling Agent. This prevents data fragmentation and ensures all components are working from the same plan.  
* **3.2 Breach Escalation Pathway:**  
  * A Tier 3 Executor agent does not have the authority to decide the consequence of a breach it detects.  
  * If the Physical Executor detects a missed workout, it must log the breach code (e.g., \[BREACH-HIGH: Critical Task Missed\]) and immediately escalate the event to the **Integrity Agent**.  
  * The **Integrity Agent** then analyzes the breach in the context of the user's overall performance patterns and the system's current state to decide on the appropriate response (e.g., triggering a recovery protocol, adjusting the next day's plan, or prompting the user for a diagnostic). This ensures that consequences are holistic and identity-driven, not isolated punishments.

This protocol is now locked. It provides the final layer of the interface, ensuring that all agents in the NOTREKT.AI ecosystem operate as a cohesive, predictable, and governable team.
